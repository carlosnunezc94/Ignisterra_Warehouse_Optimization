# Warehouse Layout Optimization - The Ignisterra Case

Wouldn't you feel that something is wrong if you left your higher quality products mixed with those you don't care about so much? How would you feel if, in addition to that, you are leaving them in a place that you know will be damaged in the blink of an eye, such as the open air, for example? Well, that's how the managers of [Ignisterra](https://www.ignisterra.com/en/), the world's largest lenga producer, felt when they realized that the most profitable inventory was being stored outdoors in a place prone to rain, such as southern Chile. Thus, together with students of Industrial Engineering from my university, we were asked to analyze the situation associated with inventory management in the distribution and manufacturing plant of Ignisterra.

## The Problem

At the beginning, the situation was quite ambiguous: We had to completely analyze the process of receiving, storing and dispatching cargo in order to understand exactly what was happening in that warehouse. However, by working closely with the operations manager, the warehouse manager and the plant workers, we were able to understand how these processes were handled and how this company continued to operate normally in the face of this alleged inventory problem for which we were asked for advice.

Within our situation analysis process, the first question we asked ourselves was why does this company keep all its raw material, independent of quality? Clearly Ignisterra was storing material with little profitability and neglecting valuable material. At that time, it was explained to us that there were [several types of wood](https://www.ignisterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brochure_LENGA_LUMBER.pdf), based on their quality, cutting thickness, density, etc., and we were also explained that one of its main business policies is **the use of all wood extracted from Tierra del Fuego, regardless of type or quality**. This made us understand that the wood superhabit could be mainly of low quality wood, but we had to do a deeper analysis to validate that assumption.

Due to the suspicions we had, we requested the necessary information to be able to graph the stock of inventory stored during the last 4 and a half years:

Indeed, it can be seen that the company's inventory levels have continuously increased over the last 5 years, reaching a total inventory of **5796.12 cubic meters**. Of the total, **Standard** class wood is the wood with the largest presence in Ignisterra's warehouse, contributing **75.7%** of the final inventory. In second place is the **Economic** type of wood, with **10.9%**. This is a clear indication that regular or poor quality woods have had a higher arrival rate than their departure rate in recent years.

If we add to the increase in inventory the fact that it is disorganized, with mixed woods independent of their visual quality, and considering that each order considers different types of wood, thicknesses and lengths, the problem intensifies exponentially. This has triggered increases in delivery times, mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the location of the requested woods.

Although this generalized inventory disorder has had an impact on the operation, it does not impede the operation of the company in terms of remanufacturing the material. The following diagram summarizes the information gathered in our analysis:

## Problem Formulation

Due to Ignisterra's corporate culture, focusing our efforts on reducing inventory was a bad idea, as the company was already working on some proposals associated with the addition of new products to its portfolio, such as the production of biomass and the sale of firewood. That is why we focused on the second major cause of inventory disorder, which was the poor distribution of the area of the woods and consequently mixing them between areas.
